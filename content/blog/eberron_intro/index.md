description: Hi Guys! If you're here for the Eberron Campaign please read this post.

So I mentioned this plan to Anna and Chorley and now we've all run away with it, but I thought I'd
take this time to write in a quick disclaimer: _this will be basically my first time DMing, so I'm keeping
worldbuilding shortish for the moment_.

Below is the general background to the world we'll be doing this in, we can flesh this out more as we go. I'm going to
try and plan for session 01 this week, but if my free time gets soaked up then we may have to postpone until I'm ready.

## Eberron

![Eberron](./eberron.jpg)

This is Eberron, where everything happens unless we leave the prime material for _antoher_ plane. Check this cool
excerpt from the sourcebook that tells us how this world was made:

> Our world was born in strife.
> The three progenitor dragons - Khyber, Siberys and Eberron - crafted the planes at the dawn of time,
> and rested in the space that lies between them. It was then that cruel Khyber turned on his siblings,
> killing noble Siberys and scattering the pieces of his body. Eberron fought Khyber, but couldn't defeat the
> dark wyrm. And so, Eberron wound Khyber in her coils and transformed, becoming a living prison that could
> forever hold the darkness within. And this is the foundation of our reality, Eberron is the Dragon Between,
> the ground upon which we stand. Khyber is the Dragon Below, source of demons and foul things. And the ring around our world is
> the broken body of Siberys, the Dragon Above, whose blood is the source of all magic.

_Pretty Cool Eh?_

So now you know that you're all gonna be doing this on the body of some god dragons, I'd better show you the continent you'll be on for now.

Also one thing to add, I'm bringing in the planes from The Forgotten Realms - so the Feywild, Shadowfell, Elemental Planes of Fire, Water, Earth and so on are all still going concerns. We even have the Nine Hells! _Thanks Khyber_

## Khorviare

Eberron is the name of the world, but Khorvaire is the name of the continent (sorry Anna and Chorley).
See below this dope map I stile from a D&D wiki.

![Khorvaire](./khorvaire.jpg)

There are some _really_ big shake ups that have happened in Khorvaire in the last 100 years that you'll all definitely know about.

- **The Last War**. Khorvaire has just emerged from a century-long civil war, and the scars
  of that bitter conflict still remain.

- **The Mourning**. This mystical cataclysm destroyed an entire nation and created a
  deadly wasteland in the heart of Khorvaire. The Mourning brought the war to an end,
  but it is a mystery and a threat that looms large over Eberron.

When she reached the first hills of the **Italic Mountains**, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown _Bookmarksgrove_, the headline of
[Alphabet Village](http://google.com) and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.

### Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.

> Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
> Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
> right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

### According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

1.  So baboon this
2.  Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey
3.  Dear foresaw hungry and much some overhung
4.  Rash opossum less because less some amid besides yikes jeepers frenetic
    impassive fruitlessly shut

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.

> The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole
and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects
again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using
her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts.

#### Silent delightfully including because before one up barring chameleon

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a
large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in
which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an
almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox

##### Wherever far wow thus a squirrel raccoon jeez jaguar this from along

She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on
the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a

met a copy.

###### Slapped cozy a that lightheartedly and far

The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return
to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it
didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk
