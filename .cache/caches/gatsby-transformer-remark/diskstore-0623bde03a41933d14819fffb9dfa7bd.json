My sticky little fingers are wrapped around the light plastic of my N64 controller and I’m about to finally play a game that I’ve only ever been able to play at my older cousin’s house. The game loads up and that’s when I’m first hit with the first of Koji Kondo’s masterpiece soundtrack. </p>\n<p>You’re immediately plunged into the game world, quickly establishing yourself as a member of a peter-pan style fairy community full of children who never grow older. Your great elder - the Deku Tree - is quick to summon you and lay upon you a great burden: to lift the curse placed upon him and leave your paradise forest, taking up a great quest to aid the princess of Hyrule in the kingdom’s protection. </p>\n<p>Unbeknowst to you, lifting the Deku Tree’s curse will kill him and your friends will denounce you for your actions. You will never be able to return to Kokiri forest, and shall grow old and perish outside it.</p>\n<p>How <em>the fuck</em> did they rate this <strong>E for Everyone</strong>???</p>\n<p>As you emerge </p>"}
