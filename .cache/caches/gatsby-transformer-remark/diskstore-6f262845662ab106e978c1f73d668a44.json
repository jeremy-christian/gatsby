My sticky little fingers are wrapped around the light plastic of my N64 controller and I’m about to finally play a game that I’ve only ever been able to play at my older cousin’s house. The game loads up and that’s when I’m first hit with the first of Koji Kondo’s masterpiece soundtrack. </p>\n<p>You’re immediately plunged into the game world, quickly establishing yourself as a member of a peter-pan style fairy community full of children who never grow older. Your great elder - the Deku Tree - is quick to summon you and lay upon you a great burden: to lift the curse placed upon him and leave your paradise forest, taking up a great quest to aid the princess of Hyrule in the kingdom’s protection. </p>\n<p>Unbeknowst to you, lifting the Deku Tree’s curse will kill him and your friends will denounce you for your actions. You will never be able to return to Kokiri forest. You shall grow old, and eventually perish outside it.</p>\n<p>How <em>the fuck</em> did they rate this <strong>E for Everyone</strong>???</p>\n<p>As you emerge into Hyrule Fields, Kondo’s score pulls you out of your shocked state with an uplifting tune that compels you to begin exploring the game’s bright and cheerful land. It isn’t until nightfall that the skeletons emerge, and hound you as you desperately wait for the drawbridge to Hyrule Market to lower at daybreak.</p>\n<p>This is where the game really shows its strength. Its a marvel of managing atmosphere, at times appearing bleak and dangerous and at others feeling cozy and welcoming.</p>\n<p>Much of the world in your childhood portion of the game is sunny and warm. Zora’s domain and Goron City is teeming with colourful creatures while Hyrlue itself brims with cheerful shopkeepers and townsfolk.</p>\n<p>In the immediate aftermath of Kokiri forest you’re sent packing to find the titular Zelda, stowed safely away in a castle full of guards and protected by a badass ninja. Your main adversaries at this stage are just adults doing their job, which does a great deal to make your adventures as a child seem very separate from whats to come. Child Link and Child Zelda must maneuver around the King and his guard, even as they watch the malevolent influence of Ganondorf creep into the kingdom.</p>\n<p>This subterfuge helps lower the stakes for you, its easier to consider your task child’s-play when the grown-ups are kept in the dark.</p>\n<p>it’s only after you’re swallowed by a fish and after you’ve blown a giant lizard up with explosives that you’re able to return to Zelda, ready and able to open up the secrets of the Temple of Time and use it’s power to halt Ganondorf. </p>"}
